### Create a shipment calculator for a shipping company
- The shipping company charges $5 per pound for the first 5 pounds
- The shipping company charges $4 per pound for the next 5 pounds
- The shipping company charges $3 per pound for the next 5 pounds
- The shipping company charges $2 per pound for the next 5 pounds
- The shipping company charges $1 per pound for the next 5 pounds

- Type of package
    - letter: 0.10 cents
    - box: 5$
    - package: 10$
- Type of shipping
    - ground: 1.5$ per pound
    - air: 2.5$ per pound
- Type of delivery
    - standard: 1 day - included
    - express: 2 days - 10$ extra
    - overnight: 3 days - 20$ extra
- Type of insurance
    - none
    - Standard : 5% of the value of the package
    - Premium : 20% of the value of the package

## STEP 2
Create a application where the user will input the following:
- The weight of the package ( users might enter a decimal number, a number followed by the word kg )
- The distance the package will travel ( in km )
- The type of package (letter, box, package)
- The type of shipping (ground, air)
- The type of delivery (standard, express, overight)
- The type of insurance (none, standard, premium)
- Client data (name, email phone number, address)

## RESULT
The application should output the following:
- The total cost of the shipment
- The total cost of the shipment with taxes (13%)
- The total cost of the shipment with taxes and insurance
- The total cost of the shipment with taxes, insurance and delivery

And a thank you message for the client
